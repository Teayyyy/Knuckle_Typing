# Informations:

* GenerateCode: 
  * Trans_Video_Images_Recognize -> Gen_Landmarks->Normalize_landmark_direction
* Train:
  * Knuckle_Recognize.py <- Model_and_DataLoader.py
* See result:
  * Video_Knuckle.py
  * Capture_recog_Knucle.py (don't work due to protobuf issue?)

#### I make this project too quick, so it's a little bit messy, if any problems, be free to ask


### Current Problems:
* Training and Testing is good, but real-time camera is not.
* Training data is directly generated by videos captured by phone camera into .jpg
* Generated jpg is not verified, so landmark-generation may not accurate
